This project conducts an in-depth analysis of a supply chain dataset stored in `SCA.csv`, uncovering actionable insights into product performance, inventory management, supplier efficiency, shipping logistics, quality control, and customer demographics. Built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment, it leverages libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `plotly` for data processing and interactive visualizations.

### Supplier Lead Time vs Defect Rates
![Lead Time vs Defect Rates Scatter Plot](assets/Results/supply1.png)

- Supplier 1: Short lead time, low defects.
- Supplier 2: Long lead time, high defects.
- Supplier 5: Medium lead time, highest defects.
- **Key Insight**: Supplier 1 is fast and reliable. Supplier 2 and 5 need quality checks.

### Average Defect Rates by Supplier
![Defect Rates by Supplier Bar Chart](assets/Results/supply2.png)

- **Key Insight**: Road’s high defects may relate to volume. Normalise data (e.g., by distance) for a fairer look.

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Skincare** dominates sales, revenue, and stock—focus here for growth.
- **"Unknown" customers** are a big chunk—collect better data to understand them.
- **Supplier 1** is reliable; **Supplier 5** needs quality work.
- **Inventory** needs balancing—high turnover SKUs must stay stocked, low ones reviewed.
- **Costs** can drop by optimising Road transport and Carrier B.
- **Quality** issues in haircare and Road transport need attention.

---

## How to Use This Analysis
- **Business Owners**: Use it to pick top products, suppliers, and cost-saving areas.
- **Supply Chain Teams**: Plan stock and shipping smarter with these insights.
- **Marketers**: Target females and decode the "Unknown" group for better campaigns.

---

## Methodology
- **Tools**: Python with `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`.
- **Visualizations**: Interactive Plotly charts (bar, pie, scatter) with custom colors (e.g., Light Blue `#ADD8E6` for `haircare`, Light Green `#90EE90` for `skincare`).
- **Processing**: Aggregations (`groupby`), sorting for descending order, and categorization (e.g., availability levels).

---

## Usage
1. **Setup**: Install dependencies (`pip install pandas numpy plotly`).
2. **Run**: Execute in Jupyter Notebook with `SCA.csv` in the working directory.
3. **Interact**: Explore charts via zoom, hover (tooltips), and legends.

---

## Future Work
- **Expand Metrics**: Include supplier reliability scores or shipping delays.
- **Advanced Sorting**: Dynamic sorting options within visualizations.
- **Cost Optimization**: Model cost-saving strategies (e.g., shift from Air to Rail).
- **Demographic Trends**: Correlate demographics with defect rates or lead times.
